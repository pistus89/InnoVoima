INNOVOIMA - the java-based irc bot build with pircbot-library

Beware!

Before you launch the bot, make sure it contains every library that is 
added with it. The conversation memory needs three txt-file which you 
have to create by yourself:

loki.txt    - collects every line that is spoken in default channel
Sitaatit.txt - random text that InnoVoima adds on launch in it's memory
Shouts.txt - file to collect all the commands that are made by users

Then MAKE SURE you register your own Microsoft Bing translator API- and 
LASTFM API -codes and add them in MyBot.java -file (inside methods .lastfm
and .tr) otherwise outcomment the .lastfm and .tr methods
